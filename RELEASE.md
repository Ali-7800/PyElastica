# Release Note (version 0.2.1)

## Developer Note

Contact model between two different rods and rod with itself is implemented. 
Testing the contact model is done through simulations. These simulation scripts can be found under
[RodContactCase](./RodContactCase). 
However, in future releases we have to add unit tests for contact model functions to test them and increase code coverage.

## Notable Changes
- #31: Merge contact model to master [PR #40 in public](https://github.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica/pull/40)
