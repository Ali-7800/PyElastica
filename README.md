PyElastica is the python implementation of **Elastica**, which is a *free* and *open-source* software project for the simulation of assemblies of slender, one-dimensional structures using Cosserat Rod theory. More information about Elastica and Cosserat rod theory is available at the Elastica [project website](https://cosseratrods.org)

The current version of PyElastica released here is the educational version. This version is a straight forward Python implementation of the Elastica code making heavy use of numpy. As such, it is very slow. We are working on a significantly accelerated Python version of the code that we hope to release soon.

## Installation 
PyElastica is compatible with Python 3.5 - 3.8. The easiest way to install PyElastica is with PIP. 

~~~bash
$ pip install pyelastica 
~~~

## Documentation
Documentation of PyElastica is available at [docs.cosseratrods.org](https://docs.cosseratrods.org/)

PyElastica is developed by the [Gazzola Lab](http://mattia-lab.com/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
