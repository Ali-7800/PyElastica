PyElastica is the python implementation of **Elastica**, which is a *free* and *open-source* software project for the simulation of assemblies of slender, one-dimensional bodies using Cosserat Rod theory. More information about Elastica and Cosserat rod theory is available at the Elastica [project website](https://cosseratrods.org)

The current version of PyElastica released here is the educational version. This version is a straight forward Python implementation of the Elastica code. As such, it is very slow. We are working on a significantly accelerated version of the code that we hope to release soon.

## Installation 
The easiest way to install PyElastica is with PIP **(not yet implemented)**. PyElastica requires Python 3.7. 

~~~python
    pip install pyelastica 
~~~
