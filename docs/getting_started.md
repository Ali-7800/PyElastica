# Getting Started

### PyElastica Overview
We have written a introductory guide to using PyElastica available on the project website [here](https://cosseratrods.org/software/pyelastica/#pyelastica-workflow)

### Tutorials
**(Under Development)**  
We are creating a number of Jupyter Notebooks and python scripts to help get users started with using PyElastica. Our goal is to upload the notebooks to [Binder](link-to-binder-notebooks), allowing you to try out some of the tutorials without having to install PyElastica. Additional examples are also available in the examples folder of PyElastica's [Github repo](link-to-github-repo).


### Visualization
If you wish to visualize your system, you can either plot your data using a python package such as `matplotlib`, or any rendering software that you choose. Note, many of the visualization scripts in the examples folders require [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (be sure to install with h264 libraries).

For high-quality visualization, we suggest [POVray](http://povray.com). See [this tutorial](link-to-POVray-tutorial) for examples of different ways of visualizing the system.
